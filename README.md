# election-results

The Election Results application is a configuration of ArcGIS Server and a HTML 5 / JavaScript application that provides election results information to the general public and other interested parties.  It is a single application that can be deployed by local governments and used by citizens on a desktop PC, mobile phone, and tablet device.  It offers a map-based view of election results that allows users to locate an address or voting precinct and review election results that are summarized in a bar chart in the information panel at the bottom of the application and an information popup for each precinct.
